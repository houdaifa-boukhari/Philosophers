# **Philosophers**

**Philosophers** is a project from the **1337 School** curriculum that simulates the "Dining Philosophers" problem using multithreading. The goal is to create a solution that avoids deadlocks, ensures proper synchronization, and demonstrates process management and resource sharing.

---

## **Features**

- **Multithreading**: Each philosopher is a separate thread, simulating independent thinkers.
- **Synchronization**: Proper synchronization is implemented to ensure that philosophers do not starve.
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Avoids deadlocks by ensuring a proper resource allocation mechanism.
- **Resource Management**: Handles shared resources (forks) without conflicts.
